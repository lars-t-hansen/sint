# sint
Subset scheme implementation in Go

To help prioritize:
- "Learn more go" -- emphasize things that do that, eg, I/O, efficiency

Near-term TODO
- more testing and bugfixing
- a verb to load and run a file
- a verb to evaluate some code
- strings
- characters
- ports, including string ports
- a number of primitives
- many more library functions, compiled-in
- apply
- multiple values
- basic error handling & recovery
- the sint/runtime package could provide a Processor abstraction that encapsulates boilerplate?

Longer-term(?) TODO
- goroutines and channels
