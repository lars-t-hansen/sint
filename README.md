# sint
Subset scheme implementation in Go

TODO in some kind of priority order
- finish the compiler - compile both to in-memory trees and to Go code on disk
- some kind of loader from file
- strings
- characters
- a number of primitives
- "Learn more go" -- emphasize things that do that, eg, I/O, efficiency
- threads!
- a way of compiling Scheme code into this system, for the std lib
- some kind of repl
